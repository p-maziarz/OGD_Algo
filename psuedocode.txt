Step 1: Choose a Problem
    - Select optimization problem
        - Example: Minimizing the quadratic function: f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 2

Step 2: Define the Optimization Problem
    - Write down the problem mathematically
        - Objective function: f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 2
        - Variable: x
        - Constraint: x âˆˆ [0, 10]

Step 3: Implement Gradient Descent
    - Function gradient_descent:
        - Input: objective_function, initial_x, learning_rate, max_iterations
        - Output: optimized_x, history_of_x
        - Initialize x with initial_x
        - Initialize empty list history_of_x
        - Repeat for i in 1 to max_iterations:
            - Evaluate objective_function at current x: current_cost = objective_function(x)
            - Compute the gradient of the objective_function at x: gradient = compute_gradient(objective_function, x)
            - Update x using the gradient descent update rule: x = x - learning_rate * gradient
            - Append x to history_of_x
        - Return optimized_x = x, history_of_x

    - Function compute_gradient:
        - Input: objective_function, x
        - Output: gradient
        - Use numerical differentiation or symbolic differentiation to compute the gradient

Step 4: Visualize the Results
    - Use Matplotlib or Seaborn to plot convergence
        - Plot iterations vs. objective_function value
        - Plot the optimized point on the objective function curve

Step 5: Analyze the Results
    - Compare optimized_x with the true minimum
    - Discuss convergence behavior

Step 6: Improve the Algorithm
    - Experiment with different learning rates, schedules, momentum, or other optimization algorithms
    - Update gradient_descent function accordingly

Step 7: Document Your Work
    - Write a report or create a presentation
        - Describe the optimization problem and objective function
        - Derive the gradient descent algorithm
        - Provide Python code for implementation
        - Include visualizations
        - Analyze and discuss results and insights gained
